# Distributed Deep Learning with Auto Encoders

This is a code repository for the codes for distributed deep learning architecture for unsupervised learning using autoencoders. This contains three parts and will be updated with more later. This repository is a part of my research internship in the Machine Intelligence Unit in the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
